How to define a composite primary key
=====================================

In Django, each model has a primary key.
By default, this primary key consists of a single field.

In most cases, a single-field primary key should suffice.
In database design, however, defining a primary key that consists of multiple
fields is sometimes necessary.

To define a composite primary key, add the ``models.CompositePrimaryKey``
field to your model:

.. code-block:: pycon

    class Tenant(models.Model):
        pass

    class User(models.Model):
        pk = models.CompositePrimaryKey("tenant_id", "id")
        tenant = models.ForeignKey(Tenant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        id = models.IntegerField()

This will instruct Django to create a composite ``PRIMARY KEY`` constraint
instead of a single-field primary key.

It's possible to define a composite primary key consisting of a single field.
This is practically the same as setting ``primary_key=True`` on the field.

.. code-block:: pycon

    class Model(models.Model):
        pk = models.CompositePrimaryKey("id")
        id = models.IntegerField()

Migrating to a composite primary key
====================================

As of now, Django doesn't offer built-in support for the migration of primary
keys.

This means once a table is created, its primary key cannot be changed via
Django's migration operations.

If you would like to migrate an existing table from a single primary key to a
composite primary key, follow your database backend's instructions to do so.

Once the composite primary key is in place, add the ``CompositePrimaryKey``
field to your model. This allows Django to recognize and handle the composite
primary key appropriately.

.. note::

    While migration operations (e.g. ``AddField``, ``AlterField``) on
    primary key fields are not supported, ``makemigrations`` will still detect
    changes.

    In order to avoid errors, it's recommended to apply such migrations with
    ``--fake``.

How to define a composite foreign key
=====================================

At the moment, ``ForeignKey`` doesn't support composite primary keys.
For the time being, the ``ForeignObject`` field can be used as an alternative:

.. code-block:: pycon

    class Comment(models.Model):
        pk = models.CompositePrimaryKey("tenant_id", "id")
        tenant = models.ForeignKey(Tenant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        id = models.IntegerField()
        user_id = models.IntegerField()
        user = models.ForeignObject(
            User,
            on_delete=models.CASCADE,
            from_fields=("tenant_id", "user_id"),
            to_fields=("tenant_id", "id"),
        )

.. warning::

    ``ForeignObject`` is an internal API. The work to provide a public API for
    composite foreign keys is still under progress. Use it at your own risk.

Composite primary keys and generic relations
============================================

The composite primary key feature is still in its infancy, it doesn't
support generic relations yet.

The work to add composite primary key support to generic relations
hasn't started yet.

Composite primary keys and database functions
=============================================

The database functions may not work with composite primary keys.

This is because most database functions accept a single field only.

.. code-block:: sql

    COUNT("id")  -- ‚úì OK
    COUNT("tenant_id", "id")  -- êÑÇ ERROR

So, unless the database function accepts multiple fields, don't
use it with a composite primary key directly.

.. code-block:: pycon

    Count("comment_set__id")  -- ‚úì OK
    Count("comment_set")  -- êÑÇ ERROR
